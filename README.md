Satoru Gojo (Japanese: 五条 悟, Hepburn: Gojō Satoru) is a character from Gege Akutami's manga Jujutsu Kaisen. 
 <br> He was first introduced in Akutami's short series Tokyo Metropolitan Curse Technical School as the mentor of the cursed teenager  <br>
 <q> <b>Yuta Okkotsu </b></q> at Tokyo Prefectural Jujutsu High School. This miniseries became the prequel Jujutsu Kaisen 0 of Jujutsu Kaisen. <br>
In Jujutsu Kaisen, Gojo takes the same role but mentors the student Yuji Itadori who suffers a similar Curse, <br>
 helping him become stronger while protecting other characters in the series. Gojo was designed by Gege Akutami to be <br>
a formidable yet endearing figure who is passionate about his students. He is voiced by <q> <u> Yūichi Nakamura </u></q> in <strong>Japanese </strong> and <q><u> Kaiji Tang </u></q> in <strong>English</strong> <br>
in the animated adaptations by MAPPA.The character was well received by the media for his carefree nature and power shown when protecting <br>
 his students, becoming the series's breakout character. Furthermore, his role in the prequel Jujutsu Kaisen 0 was <br>
appreciated by the media due to his hidden depths such as his relationship with the antagonist Suguru Geto. </em>

    Satoru is a complex individual. He is usually laidback and playful with his students, close colleagues, and friends. <br>
    However, he is unsympathetic and cruel towards sorcerer executives, 
   <br> as seen in his blatant disrespect towards <u>Principal Gakuganji </u> and his enemies.
   Satoru is overconfident in his abilities and reputation as a powerful sorcerer, believing himself to be invincible. <br>
    His opinion of others often only goes as far as his judgment of their strength, and he is rather apathetic towards anyone he deems <strong>WEAK</strong>. <br>
   Additionally, greatly influenced by his desire for power, Gojo is very arrogant. He believes himself to be the <strong> strongest </strong> in the world,<br>
   claiming, during his fight with <b> Toji Fushiguro </b>, that <strong>:-</strong></p> <h3 style="color: rgb(8, 8, 8);"><q>Throughout Heaven And Earth, [HE] Alone Is The Honored One. </h3></q> <br>

    It is evident during his task of protecting Riko Amanai, one of the few <strong> WEAK </strong> people he genuinely grew to show compassion for. <br>
     However, his regret for her death was negated by his extensive pride and arrogance after learning <u> reverse cursed technique </u> in his following battle against <b>Toji Fushiguro</b>.
     During intense battles, Satoru occasionally falls into a manic fighting state, urged by his determination for victory <br>
     and undeniable proof that he alone is the strongest. His combative style is characterized by his  <b>Aggressive and Domineering</b>  <br>
     attacks while flaunting his mastered techniques to his opponents. Furthermore, in a crisis, he is capable of being cold-blooded. <br>
    He will prioritize his enemies' destruction over saving innocent people when he believes that the <b>sacrifice </b> is unavoidable. <br>
     However, this only extends to the people killed by his opponent; he will not do any lasting harm to or kill anyone innocent to gain the upper hand. <br>
     Nevertheless, despite his arrogance and strength, Satoru is more human than he first appears. <br>
      After defeating <strong>Toji </strong>, Satoru retrieved Riko's corpse with a sorrowful look, showing that although his recent conceited victory temporarily clouded his Feelings, <br> 
    he still felt some grief over her death. He sought to kill the Star Religious Group members who were clapping over Riko's death before being stopped by <u> Suguru Geto </u> <br>
    who he relied on as a moral compass at that time — from taking any action. Furthermore, Satoru was later left visibly horrified and panicked after learning that Suguru, his <q>One And Only </q> best friend, <br>
     had become a murderous curse user. Satoru attempted to reason with his friend but eventually realized and accepted that he lost the one person he truly saw as an <b>Equal </b>. <br>
    After having to put an end to Suguru's life before more calamity arose, <br>
    It was Satoru's trauma over losing his best friend that caused his  <q>ultimate downfall</q> in <b>Shibuya </b>. <br>
    He was also distraught when Yuji seemingly died. Satoru's dream and endgame is to reform the jujutsu world from the bottom up through education. <br>
      He seeks to foster a new generation of sorcerers that he hopes will one day become his equals.

<h2 style="color: aqua;">Gojo Fight With Toji</h2>
<p style="color: rgb(250, 10, 146);">


The Sorcerer Killer dashes in a straight line for Satoru and quickly circles around his back from left to right. <br>
 Toji unloads a powerful left swing but Satoru is able to levitate to avoid it. While upside down in the air, <br>
 Satoru uses the same concept of a <q> Reverse Cursed Technique </q> and flows the positive energy into the Limitless, unleashing <a href="https://gamerant.com/jujutsu-kaisen-cursed-technique-reversal-red-explained/" target="_blank">Cursed Technique Reversal: Red!</a>
Satoru shoots <u><q>Red </q></u> from the tip of his fingers as a massive energy wave. <br>
This sends <strong> Toji </strong> flying across the nearby area clean through another building. <br>
 Toji makes sure to shield his <b> cursed spirit </b> with his own body to avoid it getting exorcised. <br>
 He's bleeding from the head but grins and admits that Satoru truly is a monster. <br>
 <br>

 <br>

Toji gets up and stretches to check for any broken bones as the inventory curse wraps back around his body. <br>
None of his bones are broken and Toji surmises that he was just hit with the <a href="https://jujutsu-kaisen.fandom.com/wiki/Limitless">Cursed Technique Reversal of the Limitless</a>. <br>
He goes over the three main abilities of the Limitless and takes out a metal chain from his curse. <br>
He connects it to the end of the <u> Inverted Spear of Heaven </u> and believes the <u> Infinity, Blue, or Red </u> won't be an issue. <br>
 Toji comes up with a countermeasure for each but there is still a heavy uneasiness resting on his shoulders. <br>
He locks eyes with Satoru and decides to ignore the uneasiness, swinging his kusagari-like weapon wildly around himself. <br>
<br>
Satoru apologizes to Riko and proclaims himself alone to be <br>
<q>the honored one</q><br>
 quoting the Buddha himself. Toji uses the chain to tear apart the ground, creating a wave of debris that <br>
forces Satoru higher in the air. Suddenly, the <u>Inverted Spear of Heaven </u> appears from the dust cloud at the same height as Satoru. <br>
 He Sorcerer Killer swings the chain, sending the <a href="https://jujutsu-kaisen.fandom.com/wiki/Cursed_Tool">Cursed tool</a> directly at Satoru, who isn't moving quickly enough through the air to avoid it.

Info on <a href="https://jujutsu-kaisen.fandom.com/wiki/Cursed_Technique#Inherited_Techniques">Inherited techniques</a> get out between other <a href="https://jujutsu-kaisen.fandom.com/wiki/Sorcerer_Clan">Sorcerer Clans</a> , <br>
 so Satoru surmises the assassin is probably from the <a href="https://jujutsu-kaisen.fandom.com/wiki/Sorcerer_Clan/Zenin_Clan"> Zenin Family</a>. <br>
 However, there is a technique in the Limitless' arsenal that is only known to a few even within the <a href="https://jujutsu-kaisen.fandom.com/wiki/Sorcerer_Clan#Gojo">Gojo Clan</a> . <br>

 The awakened Limitless user combines Red and Blue to unleash the imaginary mass that erases everything it touches into nothingness, <br>
  <a href="https://jujutsu-kaisen.fandom.com/wiki/Hollow_Technique:_Purple">Hollow Technique: Purple!</a> Toji's entire left side of his torso is hit by <br>
  Hollow Technique: Purple, instantly breaking his metal chain and ending his offense in one motion. <br>

Toji realizes that he should have run away since he wasn't getting paid to fight anymore anyway. <br>
 He couldn't let go of his grudge towards the jujutsu world and understands at that point he had already lost. <br>
  Disappointed, Toji looks down as the eviscerated left section of his torso drips blood profusely onto the ground  where his severed arm lies. <br>
 The Disappointment comes from believing he had shoved away such petty pride. <br>
